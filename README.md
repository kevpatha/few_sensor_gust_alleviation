# few_sensor_gust_alleviation
This repository includes the code used to orchestrate the morphing wing gust rejection experiment, and perform data analysis. 

Please note that due to the large volume of testing and training data, the data was consolidated from original format in order to streamline loading process
for implementing data analysis code. Still, this code was included to illustrate our experiment methods as implemented.
Therefore, the file directories in the experiment training and testing code ("Run_...ipynb") do not match that of the data available in the "Data.zip" file.
Still, all data available in "Data.zip" is otherwise unmanipulated "raw" data. Any formatting or cleaning of the data are shown in the "...data_analysis.ipynb" files.
